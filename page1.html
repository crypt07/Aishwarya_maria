<p><center><font size="4" face="arial">In 1988, global warming and the depletion of the ozone layer became increasingly prominent in the international public debate and political agenda.</font></Center></p> 
<p><center><font size="4" face="arial"><center>Many parts of the world are witnessing natural disasters like hurricanes, floods, and avalanches. All these phenomena are a direct result of global warming. To prevent our environment from the harmful effects of global warming, we must restoring our ecosystem. Man has been exploiting natural resources without giving the environment anything in return. This needs to be stopped. We must all join forces to make this world a better place for our future generations who deserve this planet as much as we do. The basic step that we can follow to increase the overall health of our planet is planting trees. Afforestation should be our primary goal. The earth can become a better place if we pledge to plant as many trees as we can in our lifetime.</center></font></p>
