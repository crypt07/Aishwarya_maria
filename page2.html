  <p align="center">The greenhouse is the main cause for the curretnt global warming trend becuase sunlight passes through the atmosphere and warms the Earth's surface, the heat is radiated back towards space. However, about 90% of the outgoing heat is absorbed by the greenhouse and it is re-emitted in different directions, warming the Earth's surface, and the lower atmosphere.</p>

    <p align="center">Buring fossil fuel is a factor that cuase global warming to increase because when fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas, are burnt they release CO2 into the atmosphere, the layer of the greenhouse gas is getting thicker. When the layer gets thicker, then the Earth gets warmer.</p>
